Requires at least: 2.6
Tested up to: 3.1.2
Stable tag: trunk

== Description ==

Create a library of raw HTML snippets that you can easily insert into any page/post content using a shortcode:

[raw_html_snippet id="my-snippet"]

Snippets consist of a unique ID (e.g. "my-snippet") and raw HTML code. This plugin was written to stop using hacks that override WordPress' core content filters and affect shortcode output.

This plugin will NOT taint your content or the output of other shortcodes. If you delete a snippet, any existing shortcodes with that snipet's ID will output an empty string.

== Installation ==

1. Download and unzip to the 'wp-content/plugins/' directory 
2. Activate the plugin.
3. Use Settings > Raw HTML Snippets to add, edit and remove your snippets.
4. Insert snippets at your will

== Screenshots ==

1. Plugin admin screen.
2. Editing a snippet
3. Inserting a snippet
